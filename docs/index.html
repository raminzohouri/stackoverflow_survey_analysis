<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">A data based approach using Stack Overflow’s developer survey data from 2020.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8><a id="Introdution_7"></a>Introdution</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="11">In the software and tech-industry developers are playing a key role on building products and advancing the technology.<br>
Their existence and contributions are very crucial for success of big project. Organizations from different size are<br>
actively trying to higher good developers and also keep their current best developers satisfied at their workplace.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="16">There are multiple reason which cause developers to change their organization, better prospect, working condition, or<br>
because they are not satisfied with their current working condition. I personally have my own point of view on the<br>
subject. However, it is helpful to have a look at the broad landscape of the software development and engineering to<br>
gather some insight on developers interest and wishes.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="23"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">&lt;img align=“left” width=“300” height=“100” src=“https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/company/Img/logos/so/so-logo.svg?v=a010291124bf”&gt;<br>
</a> Therefore, I used data from Stackoverflow’s <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey">2020 Annual Developer Survey</a>, to take a<br>
closer look at this questions. The survey collect information from 64,000 reviews from 183 countries and territories.<br>
The survey aims to understand multiple aspects of jobs related to software development and data analytics. There were more than 63 questions<br>
as a part of the survey, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="27">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26"><em>Which of the following best describes the highest level of formal education that you’ve completed?</em></p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="29">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28"><em>How satisfied are you with your current job?</em></p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="31">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30"><em>Imagine that you are deciding between two job offers with the same compensation, benefits, and location.</em></p>
</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32">
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32"><em>How frequently do you learn a new language or framework?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="38">Generally speaking we can gain knowledge about technological landscape and recent developments in software related industries<br>
including Mobile and Web Apps, hardware programming, self-driving car, etc…, by looking at what trend developers are<br>
pursuing and how their choice of programming language, operation system, database have change during recent past few years.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40"><img src="../data/technology.png" alt="alt text" title="Comparing technology trending between 2019 and 2020"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42"><img src="../data/programming-language.png" alt="alt text" title="Comparing programming language trending between 2019 and 2020"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44"><img src="../data/database.png" alt="alt text" title="Comparing database trending between 2019 and 2020"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="52">On these tree graphs we compare the trends in Database, Programming Language, and Technology usage of developers from<br>
year 2019 to the year 2020. Looking one year back we can gain some insight on that are new interests.<br>
It is visible that developers are showing more interest in programming language such as “Rust” which guaranties safety<br>
and security and at the same time reduces the complexity of garbage collection and memory checking. The same pattern<br>
appears in using development kit like “Flutter” which is a brand new coding environment that enables fast and convenient<br>
development. It can be said that developers are looking for combination programming languages and software developing kits which make their life easier by preserving the<br>
practicality.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=53 data-line-end=54><a id="Part_II_How_higher_education_plays_a_role_53"></a>Part II: How higher education plays a role?</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="58">For organizations its important to add well educated and expert developer into their workforce. Offering attractive salary<br>
and employment packages is one of the key players in highers such developers. based on graphic between year 2019 and 2020<br>
there was increase in the number of developers with 6 digit salaries.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="60"><img src="../data/education-salary.png" alt="alt text" title="Comparing salary developers with higher education between 2019 and 2020"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="63">On the level organization level it is hard to make judgment where the developer with higher education work. But based on the<br>
graphic below most of the well educated developers in the year 2020 tend to work in middle size or smaller companies.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="70" data-line-end="73">After all what keeps expert developer happy and keeps them in the company they are working for a long time? Answer to<br>
this question is not only salary and high payment but why and how developer are looking for new opportunities. What is<br>
their demographic, education background what other parameter correlate with job satisfaction of the developer.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="74" data-line-end="75"><img src="../data/jobhunt.png" alt="alt_text" title="Jub huntting reasons"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="76" data-line-end="79">Next to better compensation growth or leadership opportunities and being curious about other opportunities also are major<br>
reason why developers leave a company and look for new job. In comparison to year 2019 number of developer who actively<br>
are looking for new positions has increased. Overall developer are passively looking for new opportunities.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="83" data-line-end="84">In this article focused on what keep developers in their job according to Stack Overflow 2019 and 2020 survey data.</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="84" data-line-end="85">we took a look at software and technology landscape and what is trending among developers</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="85" data-line-end="86">we observed salary and payment distribution look like for developers with higher eduction.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="86" data-line-end="87">we developer passively look for new opportunities regardless if they are satisfied in their current position.</li>
